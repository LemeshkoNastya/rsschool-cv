## __About me__
I am a student of Samara University, the direction of "Applied mathematics and computer science".

In the summer, I had an internship at the company "SMS - Information technologies" in Samara. During the internship, we were mastering the stages of Analytics (creating a site layot in Figma, drawing up a requirements specification in Wiki, creating an ER-model in DrawIO), development and testing (drawing up a checklist for testing our program on different browsers).

I am currently taking the "JavaScript and React + Redux" course on Udemy.

After graduation I'm about to move to Saint Petersburg. Therefore, I intend to successfully complete the training at RS School for advanced training.
